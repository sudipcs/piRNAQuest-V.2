# piRNAQuest-V.2
piRNAQuest V.2 is a comprehensive updated resource for piRNAs of 28 species with 92,77,689 unique piRNAs. 
A definitive objective of piRNAQuest V.2 is to provide data on fundamental piRNA features reliant on their genomic location, with additional details on their overlap with Repeat elements, Pseudogenes and Syntenic regions.

I have developed piRNAQuest V.2 which serves as a valuable resource for the scientific community. The database was developed using PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL, and it has demonstrated its utility in advancing research in non-coding RNA biology.
